# Coffee_Roastery_DB
A database driven website for a mock coffee roastery company named Space Cowboy 

Space Cowboy Coffee Connections is a cafe partner business that generates 2 million in sales
annually. The main goal of the company is to connect cafes to different roasteries to allow cafes
to expand the amount of coffee they can sell. They are currently working with 20 small cafes
local to Portland, Oregon, and 10 different roasteries from across the United States. The Space
Cowboys are growing in popularity and need a way to keep track of their partner roasteries,
cafes, and their invoices. They also want to keep track of which coffees they sell to which cafes
so they can return that information to their roastery partners. A database driven website will
allow them to track their invoices, partners, and most frequently sold coffees, which in turn will
help them to provide future business advice to their partners for mutual success.
